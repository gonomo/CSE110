# Yousuf Gharib
I am Yousuf Gharib, a Saudi international student. I came here to the US with the intention of experiecing a new kind of life, but oh boy. It is more than I even Imagined.

The experience was one of the most transformative experiences I have ever had. I had somewhat of an **existential dread**.

Nevertheless, I seek solace in coding
> Software Develoment: religion

```
git init
git commit -m yes
git push
```

The way I learned coding is mainly through [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com)
